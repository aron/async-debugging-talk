Overview
--------

A crash course in debugging JavaScript in the browser, with Aron Carroll.

Nobody writes perfect code on the first attempt, so it’s important to be
able to locate and fix bugs quickly. Fortunately all modern browsers have
tools to inspect our code and find errors with ease.

In this session, we’ll take a look at the browser’s console and debugger
to pause running JavaScript with ‘breakpoints’ and step through the code
in order to find the source of an error. We will see how to get the most
out of the Web Inspector in [Safari][:safari] and [Chrome][:chrome], as
well as the popular [Firebug][:firebug] add-on for Firefox.
